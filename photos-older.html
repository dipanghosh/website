	<p>Photography is one of my long term passion, and over time, I have gotten somewhat serious about it. During my stay in IISc, I taught myself photography, which, as <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Ben-Long/748177-1.html">Ben Long</a> puts it, is an act of seeing actively. That made a lot of sense to me once I started practicing it. Every day, as we wander about doing our daily work, or, even when we are roaming around, spending good time, we see many things, but we dont NOTICE them. It is this difference of taking a different vew of the world in front of us, is what has intrigued me the most. </p>
	<p>On another note, photography has two sides, art and craft. The craft side is very technical, as it deals with lots of sciency things <a href="#photographyCraft"> discussed below</a>. The nerd in me is very interested in this, so I am interested in phtography. On a deeper level, photography is an art form. Photography is lively and beautiful. It is the combination of both, that I like most in photography, and that is the reason it has fascinated me.</p>
	<p>This is a library of all my images, presented in an organised way, with the best possible quality. If you enjoy it, please <a href="#">get in touch</a> with me!</p>

	  <h2>Photography Gear</h2>
		<p>Gear Gear O Dear! Photography is a seriously gear oriented business, but at the end of the day, it is the person behind the camera taking the picture. Some basic gear is essential for photography, sometime your gear will limit the kind of shooting you can do. However, more often than not, excellent images can be taken with a basic camera, and by basic I mean any camera with manual controls. </p>
		<p>At this point, I have Canon EOS 6D as my primary camera, with a Tamron 24-70,f/2.8. If you dont know what those numbers mean, dont worry. I also have a GoPro Hero5 Black, primarily for shooting in bad weather and water. The GoPro also have an extremely wide angle lens, which sometimes comes in handy. </p>

		<h2>Art and craft of Photography</h2>
		<p>If you get a bit serious about photograpy, you would find that photography is a multi-faceted discipline. There are so many sides to explore, and as technology evolves, new medium and opportunities open up. Areal drone photography, and VR techniques are just coming out today, and this keeps the creative horizones ever expanding. Because of my interest, I thought it would be appropriate to discuss some aspects of photogaphy as I see it. That way, a less experience person can pick up he relevant vocabulary and have a new viewpoint to the photographs presented. Although most of the discussions here are generic, it woud be mixed in with my own opinion and point of view. If you are new to photograpy, or are interested, this may be a good read for you.</p>
		<h4 class="mark">I would write this piece by piece. Stay tuned!</h4>

		<h2>How to learn</h2>
		<p>The main part of learing photography is to take picture. Unless you actually shoot, bookish knowledge would not help. Ideally, you would have an SLR/Mirrorless camera, but not having one is fine as well. I learnt photography when I did not have one myself, I borrowed frm friends to get the practical hands on training. That being said, you would have to learn the basic theory of photography, and maybe even a bit of history. There are very good online resources out there, you can find yourself a book if that's your thing, or, if you find video tutorials more useful then I would definitely recommend <a href="https://lynda.com">Lynda.com</a>. Check out the <a href="https://www.lynda.com/learning-paths/Photography/become-a-photographer">Become a Photographer</a> learning path which features a bunch of great courses, along with  the <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Digital-Photography-tutorials/foundations-of-photography-exposure/71923-2.html">Foundation of photography series</a> by Ben Long. I have learnt all the basics from here, so definitely check it out.</p>
