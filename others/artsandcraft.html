	<h1 class="text-info text-center">The Arts and Craft of Photography</h1>
	Photography is an extremely versetile field. If you think carefully, you would see that it has a very wide scope. Let me explain:
	Photogrpahy starts with a camera, and there is a very technical side to the camera, all the innovation that has gone into it, and are still going on are a topic of interest in itself. If you look back in time, you'd find that Chemistry and Photography were very much intertwined with each other. The film to the negetive plate to the development of the final image involved some fine chemistry back in the day. On the same note, fast forward to the modern day camera, and you'd find sophisticaed physics that starts with Photoelectric effect, discovered by Albert Einstein, which was used to make the charged couples devices (CCD), from which came the modern day camera sensor. Since I have mentioned Physics and Chemistry, biology cannot be far behind, as bio-imaging is a very active field of research. Although it drifts from the general notion of Photography, in the broader scope, it still counts as <q>taking pictures</q>. Now turn your attention from all the fancy science and look at the picture! Photography is an art form by its very nature. Especially still photographs can exude emotions like very few other medium can. It provides photographic evidance, and puts an artistic voice to it at the same time. This is the unique power of photography, and such is its immense scope.
	With the advent of the digital camera and especially the mobile camera, everyone now has access to at least some camera. This in one hand has made photogrpahy possible and accessible for everybosy, and on the other hand has resulted in a dilution of quality. A camera is just a machine, an instrument, which <em>YOU</em> use to make the phtograph. Just having a camera does not mean you can take great pictures, just as handing someone a cricket bat does not make one a batsman. That is why, whoever wants to take good photographs, must practice and must know the key principles of photogrpahy. Armed with such knowledge, you may take a killer shot just with your cellphone camera under the right circumstances. On the other hand though, even if you have a great camera, without knowing how to shoot how to make a good photograph, you will get medicore images most of the time.

		<h2>The Terminology</h2>
		<p>Photography sure has a lot of jargons, but some of them are key. You at least need some vocabulary to understand, and communicate with others about photography. Here is the short list of the ones I consider essential</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Exposure</dt>
			<dd>Exposure in photography is just a measure amount of light that hits your <q>sensor</q>. This is usually determined by three factors, namely
			<ul>
				<li>Shutter speed</li>
				<li>Sensitivity or gain factor of the sensor (ISO)</li>
				<li>Aperture of the lens</li>
			</ul>
			These three, famously quoted as the <q>the exposure triangle</q> interacts with each other to determine how much light hits the sensor, and how bright or <q>exposed</q> the final image is. There are plenty of places where you can find a thorough overview of this, so I would not go into further details of this. However, it is crucial that you understand how the exposure triangle works to give you an well exposed image. This is one of the fundametal pillars of photography concepts.
			</dd>
			<dt>Depth of Field(DOF) and Aperture</dt>
			<dd>Depth of field is the measure of <q>depth</q> in the scene that is in focus. When in an image, just a small part is in focus, and rest is blurry, it is known as a <q>SHALLOW</q> DOF, and when everything is in focus, that is <q>DEEP</q> DOF. Now this is directly controlled by the aperture of the lens. In brief, smaller the aperture, deeper the DOF. Aperture is written as a fraction,(f/number) and larger the number gets, smalle r is the aperture. Yes, it gets a bit confusing n the begining, but again, there are lots of places where you would find this discussed in detail, and a bit of understanding here would go a long way.</dd>
