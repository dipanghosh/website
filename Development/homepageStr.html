			<p>Hello! I am Dipan, and welcome to my little corner in the web.  I am a researcher, photography enthusiast, and graphic designer, now that is not a very common combination! I am currently pursuing my PhD, and I sometime delve into photographic explorations and art. This is the platform where I hope to present and publish all that I do, because posting in social media is just too old! So feel free to look around and enjoy. If you have anything to say, please let me know, I would love to hear it!</p>

			<p>Photography is a combination of art and craft, it is as much technical as it is an art form.  It is this marriage of art and technology in photography that has fascinated me. Having a strong scientific background, I am always keen to learn the techlogical details, and just blown away by the art that photography is. So, please have a look around, and explore my photographic vision!</p>
